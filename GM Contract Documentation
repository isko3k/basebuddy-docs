# GM Contract

Say **GM** to the Base blockchain — and let it remember forever.  
Each greeting records your presence, builds streaks, and earns you **energy points**.  
It’s proof that you showed up today.

## Overview

The **GM Contract** is your onchain greeting system on **Base**.  
Every time you say GM, the blockchain:

- Records your greeting permanently  
- Tracks your **daily streaks**  
- Rewards you with **energy points**  
- Keeps an immutable record of your engagement  

Think of it as **proof-of-presence** — showing up every day and saying GM becomes your onchain ritual.

## How It Works

### Sending a GM

When you call the `Greeter()` function:

1. The contract checks you’ve waited at least **1 hour** since your last GM  
2. Updates your **current streak** (consecutive days saying GM)  
3. Tracks how many GMs you’ve sent **today**  
4. Awards **energy points** based on your activity  
5. Records your stats **onchain forever**

### Energy Rewards System

| GM Count Today | Energy Earned | Action Type |
|----------------|----------------|--------------|
| 1st GM | 100 points | `gm_first` |
| 2nd–4th GM | 200 points each | `gm_streak` |
| 5th GM | 500 points (bonus) | `gm_5_bonus` |
| 6th+ GM | 200 points each | `gm_streak` |

#### 5-GM Bonus
Once per day, hitting your **5th GM** triggers a **500-point bonus**.  
After that, additional GMs earn the standard **200 points**.

### Streak System

Your streak increases every consecutive day you say GM.

| Action | Result |
|---------|--------|
| Say GM on a new day | Streak starts at **1** |
| Say GM the next day | Streak **increases** |
| Miss a day | Streak **resets** to 1 |
| Best streak | Saved permanently |

**Example:**

| Day | Action | Result |
|-----|---------|--------|
| Day 1 | GM | Streak: 1 |
| Day 2 | GM | Streak: 2 |
| Day 3 | GM | Streak: 3 |
| Day 5 | (missed Day 4) | Streak reset to 1 |

---

### Cooldown System

- **1 hour cooldown** between each GM  
- Multiple GMs per day are allowed (if spaced out)  
- Daily GM counter resets at **midnight UTC**

You can send up to **24 GMs per day**, though most users send 1–5 for maximum efficiency.
