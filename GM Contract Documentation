Overview
The GM Contract is your onchain greeting system on Base. Every time you say GM, the blockchain records it forever, tracks your dedication through streaks, and rewards you with energy points.

What Is The GM Contract?
Think of it as a proof-of-presence system — show up, say GM, and the blockchain remembers. Your greetings aren't just messages; they're timestamped records showing when and how often you engaged with the Base community.

How It Works
Sending a GM
When you call the Greeter() function:

The contract checks you've waited at least 1 hour since your last GM
It updates your streak (consecutive days saying GM)
It tracks how many GMs you've sent today
It awards energy points based on your daily activity
Your stats are permanently recorded onchain


Energy Rewards System
Your energy rewards scale with daily activity:
GM Count TodayEnergy EarnedAction Type1st GM100 pointsgm_first2nd-4th GM200 points eachgm_streak5th GM500 points (bonus)gm_5_bonus6th+ GM200 points eachgm_streak
The 5-GM Bonus
Once per day, hitting your 5th GM triggers a 500-point bonus. After claiming this bonus, additional GMs that day earn the standard 200 points.

Streak System
How Streaks Work

New streak: Say GM on a new day → streak starts at 1
Continue streak: Say GM the next consecutive day → streak increases
Break streak: Miss a day → streak resets to 1
Best streak: Your longest streak is saved forever

Streak Examples
Day 1: GM → Streak: 1
Day 2: GM → Streak: 2
Day 3: GM → Streak: 3
Day 5: GM (missed day 4) → Streak: 1 (reset)

Cooldown System
Rules

1 hour cooldown between GMs
Multiple GMs per day are allowed (if spaced 1 hour apart)
Daily GM counter resets at midnight UTC

What This Means
You can send up to 24 GMs per day (one every hour), but most users send 1-5 GMs daily to maximize efficiency.

Your Stats
What's Tracked
The contract stores these stats for every user:

Reading Your Stats
Call getMyStats() to see:
javascript{
  totalGms: 127,           // All-time GM count
  currentStreak: 15,       // Days in a row
  bestStreak: 23,          // Personal record
  gmsToday: 3,             // Today's count
  lastTime: 1698765432,    // Unix timestamp
  cooldown: 3245,          // Seconds until next GM
  nextEnergyReward: 200    // Points for next GM
}

Global Statistics
Community Metrics
The contract tracks:

Total GMs sent by all users
Total unique users who've ever GM'd
GMs sent today across the network
Peak daily GMs (all-time record)

These stats show the pulse of the Base community — how active everyone is and when engagement peaks.

Gas Optimization
The contract is designed to minimize gas costs:
Storage Efficiency

Packed storage structs reduce gas by 40-60%
Single transaction updates all your stats
Events are free for users (emitted after state changes)

What This Means
Saying GM costs approximately 50,000-70,000 gas (~$0.10-0.30 depending on Base gas prices).

Use Cases
For Individuals

Build streaks to show consistent engagement
Earn energy to unlock future features
Prove presence with immutable onchain records
Track habits via blockchain timestamps

For Communities

Engagement metric for DAOs and projects
Onchain attendance for events or programs
Proof of participation for airdrops or rewards
Community health indicator via daily GM counts


Best Practices
Maximizing Rewards

Say GM once daily to build streaks
Aim for 5 GMs per day to hit the bonus (if active)
Set reminders to maintain your streak
Check your cooldown timer before sending

Efficient Usage

One GM per day is enough to maintain streaks
Multiple GMs per day boost energy but require more transactions
The 5-GM bonus is worth pursuing if you're very active


Common Questions
Q: What happens if I miss a day?
A: Your streak resets to 1, but your total GMs and longest streak are preserved.
Q: Can I GM multiple times per day?
A: Yes, with a 1-hour cooldown between each GM.
Q: When does the daily counter reset?
A: Midnight UTC. Your GM count and 5-GM bonus eligibility reset then.
Q: Do energy points expire?
A: No. Energy points are permanent and tracked in the Energy Registry contract.
Q: Can I transfer my streak to another wallet?
A: No. Streaks and stats are tied to your wallet address permanently.
