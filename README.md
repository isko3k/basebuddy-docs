What You Can Do
GM Contract
Send a GM message that lives onchain forever. Every time you say GM, the contract tracks your streak and awards you energy points. Think of it as proof you showed up today. Your GM count and last message are stored on the blockchain, and your energy points grow with every greeting. Build your streak, earn rewards, and show the Base community you're here to build.
Onchain Messenger
Leave your message on the Base blockchain permanently. Write messages, reply to others, and like posts that resonate with you. Every message earns you badges based on your activity - from First Signer to Conversationalist. Your display name and all interactions are stored onchain forever, creating a permanent record of the Base community's conversations.
Create Your Own Token
Launch your own ERC-20 token in seconds. You choose the name, ticker symbol, and total supply. Want to add a burn function that reduces supply by 1% per transaction? That's optional too. Once deployed, your token exists on the Base network and can be traded or sent to other wallets. All your created tokens are tracked and displayed in your profile.
Mint an NFT
Create your own ERC-721 NFT with just a name and description. No complex metadata or IPFS hosting needed. Your NFT gets minted to your wallet immediately and you own it completely. Great for testing, creating collectibles, or just seeing how NFTs work. Track all your minted NFTs directly from the platform.
Deploy a Smart Contract
Become a smart contract owner by deploying your own HelloWorld contract through our factory. The contract is yours to control and experiment with. This is a good way to understand how contract ownership works before diving into more complex projects. View all your deployed contracts and their addresses anytime.
Simple Staking
Stake BUDDY tokens and earn rewards based on your lock period. Choose from three options: 1 week at 50% APY, 1 month at 100% APY, or 3 months at 200% APY. Claim your accumulated rewards while keeping tokens staked, or unstake everything when the lock period expires. Need BUDDY tokens? Use the built-in faucet to claim 1,000 tokens every 24 hours for testing.
Payment Splitter Factory
Create payment splitters to automatically distribute funds among multiple recipients. Perfect for team payments, revenue sharing, or any scenario where funds need to be split among several addresses. Add up to 10 recipients, define their shares, and the contract handles the rest. Supports ETH, USDC, and cbBTC.
Swap Tokens
Access the Uniswap widget directly from the platform to swap tokens on Base. The familiar interface makes it easy to trade any tokens you've created or acquired.
Bridge Assets
Need to move assets to Base from other chains? We've included a direct link to the official Base bridging documentation so you can transfer funds safely.
Energy System
BaseBuddy features a global energy system that rewards your onchain activity. Earn energy points by sending GMs, creating tokens, minting NFTs, deploying contracts, and leaving messages. Your energy accumulates over time and is tracked both personally and globally. Check your energy stats anytime to see how you rank in the BaseBuddy community.

Why Use BaseBuddy?
Learning blockchain development can be intimidating. BaseBuddy removes the coding barrier so you can focus on understanding what smart contracts actually do. Deploy real contracts, see how they work, and build from there. Everything happens on the Base network, so gas fees stay low while you experiment.
Need Help?
All contracts deployed through BaseBuddy are standard smart contracts on Base. You can view them on Basescan, interact with them through other tools, or even build on top of them. The code is straightforward and follows common patterns used across the ecosystem.
Start with the GM contract if you're brand new. It's simple, costs almost nothing, and shows you the full cycle of deploying and interacting with a smart contract. Then explore the onchain messenger to see how social interactions work onchain, or try staking BUDDY tokens to understand how DeFi protocols operate.
