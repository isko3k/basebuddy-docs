## What You Can Do

### GM Contract
Send a GM message that lives **onchain forever**.  
Every time you say GM, the contract tracks your streak and awards energy points — think of it as **proof you showed up today**.  
Your GM count and last message are stored on the blockchain, and your energy points grow with every greeting.

---

### Onchain Messenger
Leave your message on the **Base blockchain permanently**.  
Write posts, reply to others, and like messages that resonate with you.  
Every message earns you badges based on activity — your display name and interactions are stored **onchain forever**, forming a permanent record of Base community conversations.

---

### Create Your Own Token
Launch your own **ERC-20 token** in seconds.  
You choose the:
- **Name**
- **Ticker symbol**
- **Total supply**
- *(Optional)* Burn function  

Once deployed, your token exists on the Base network and can be traded or sent to other wallets.

---

### Mint an NFT
Create your own **ERC-721 NFT** with just a **name and description** — no IPFS or metadata setup required.  
Your NFT is minted directly to your wallet, ready to collect, trade, or test.

---

### Deploy a Smart Contract
Become a smart contract owner by deploying through our **HelloWorld factory**.  
You’ll gain control and ownership over the contract — perfect for learning how contract ownership and deployment work.

---

### Simple Staking
Stake **BUDDY tokens** and earn rewards based on your lock period:

| Lock Period | APY |
|--------------|-----|
| 1 week | 50% |
| 1 month | 100% |
| 3 months | 200% |

Claim rewards while keeping tokens staked, or unstake after your lock expires.  
Need tokens? Use the **built-in faucet** to claim **1,000 BUDDY** every 24 hours.

### Payment Splitter Factory
Automatically distribute payments among multiple recipients.  
You can:
- Add up to **10 recipients**
- Define each recipient’s **share**
