# BaseBuddy Documentation

Welcome to BaseBuddy, your friendly gateway to building on Base. This platform lets you deploy smart contracts and interact with the blockchain without writing a single line of code.

## Smart Contract Addresses

Here are the core BaseBuddy contracts deployed on Base:

- **Token Creator Contract**: `0xDd0a588266c9B784D6029b40D4775E953eF265cd`
- **NFT Minter Contract**: `0x874d80481f96D8EC1373e445144E97a6c265FbA2`
- **gm Contract**: `0x5F943004282B9929F3682FA165ffF62Ec8029eE3`
- **Smart Contract Deployer Contract**: `0x1D39960Ad3cc82c9466d850d7C207050573A8128`

## What You Can Do

### GM Contract

Send a GM message that lives onchain forever. Every time you say GM, the contract tracks your streak and awards you energy points. Think of it as proof you showed up today. Your GM count and last message are stored on the blockchain, and your energy points grow with every greeting.

### Create Your Own Token

Launch your own ERC-20 token in seconds. You choose the name, ticker symbol, and total supply. Want to add a burn function? That's optional too. Once deployed, your token exists on the Base network and can be traded or sent to other wallets.

### Mint an NFT

Create your own ERC-721 NFT with just a name and bio. No complex metadata or IPFS hosting needed. Your NFT gets minted to your wallet immediately and you own it completely. Great for testing, creating collectibles, or just seeing how NFTs work.

### Deploy a Smart Contract

Become a smart contract owner by deploying your own contract through our HelloWorld factory. The contract is yours to control and experiment with. This is a good way to understand how contract ownership works before diving into more complex projects.

### Swap Tokens

Access the Uniswap widget directly from the platform to swap tokens on Base. The familiar interface makes it easy to trade any tokens you've created or acquired.

### Bridge Assets

Need to move assets to Base from other chains? We've included a direct link to the official Base bridging documentation so you can transfer funds safely.

## Getting Started

1. Connect your wallet to the Base network
2. Make sure you have some ETH on Base for gas fees
3. Pick any feature and click deploy
4. Confirm the transaction in your wallet
5. That's it. Your contract is live.

## Why Use BaseBuddy?

Learning blockchain development can be intimidating. BaseBuddy removes the coding barrier so you can focus on understanding what smart contracts actually do. Deploy real contracts, see how they work, and build from there. Everything happens on the Base network, so gas fees stay low while you experiment.

## Need Help?

All contracts deployed through BaseBuddy are standard smart contracts on Base. You can view them on Basescan, interact with them through other tools, or even build on top of them. The code is straightforward and follows common patterns used across the ecosystem.

Start with the GM contract if you're brand new. It's simple, costs almost nothing, and shows you the full cycle of deploying and interacting with a smart contract.
