Send a GM message that lives **onchain forever**.  
Every time you say GM, the contract tracks your streak and awards energy points — think of it as **proof you showed up today**.  
Your GM count and last message are stored on the blockchain, and your energy points grow with every greeting.

---

### 💬 Onchain Messenger
Leave your message on the **Base blockchain permanently**.  
Write posts, reply to others, and like messages that resonate with you.  
Every message earns you badges based on activity — your display name and interactions are stored **onchain forever**, forming a permanent record of Base community conversations.
